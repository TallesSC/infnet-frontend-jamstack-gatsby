I've been living with a beta version of Apple Intelligence for over a month, and life hasn't changed much since its features arrived on my iPhone 16 Pro.

If you haven't braved the public beta, today you'll get to experience it for yourself. Apple is finally shipping its much-hyped artificial intelligence suite of features in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and MacOS Sequoia 15.1, software updates rolling out for select iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

Powered by the company's large language models, Apple Intelligence has been pushed as one of the biggest reasons to buy the new iPhone 16, iPad Mini, or iMac. At WWDC this past June, Tim Cook said it would take the experience of using Apple products to "new heights." The problem? That experience, in its current form, is quite flat.
