Wireless carriers in the US go out of their way to make expensive smartphones seem affordable. AT&T will advertise a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra for just $36 a month, but don't let them fool you. Over 36 monthly installments, you're still spending more than a thousand bucks for a phone. Your pricey device may also keep you locked into the network, unable to switch wireless carriers until the phone is paid off.

Forget the spendy option and get a seriously great affordable smartphone instead. Every year, I test a dozen or more devices to find the best cheap phones that perform where it counts and aren’t annoyingly slow. Our top pick, the Google Pixel 8A, costs $499 and is as good as almost any device, and our other choices strike a great balance between price and luxury. There's even a folding phone in this guide!

## Best Cheap Phone

Google's Pixel 8A (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best smartphone you can buy for the money. At just $499, you get a little of everything—from wireless charging to top-of-the-line performance. It's powered by Google's Tensor G3 processor, the same that's inside the flagship Pixel 8 series, and that also means this midrange smartphone will get seven years of software support—a rarity at this price. That means you can expect to get Android OS upgrades with new features plus security patches for a long time.

This Pixel has a better OLED screen than its predecessor, meaning it gets even brighter and plenty visible on the sunniest days, and the 120-Hz screen refresh rate makes every interaction feel fluid. The 6.1-inch screen is fairly compact, so it's great if you're eyeing a small phone. The whole thing also just looks pretty—budget and midrange phones tend to look super boring, but the Pixel 8A has a smart design with a matte rear texture. Plus, the new Aloe color is gorgeous. Phones are personal, and they should look pretty!

Performance has been flawless in my testing—I covered Google I/O with this as my primary device, taking photos, navigating, using the Google Recorder app, and posting to social media. The downside is battery life. The 4,492-mAh battery cell can last a day with average use, but heavy users will likely need to top up before bedtime. Keep a portable power bank handy.

The cameras are the highlight of the Pixel series, and the Pixel 8A lives up to this legacy—it's easily the best camera phone for the money. It has a 64-megapixel main camera that snaps detailed, colorful, and sharp photos in any lighting condition. Joining it is a capable 13-MP ultrawide, and the 13-MP selfie camera is solid, though the fact that it's fixed focus means your face is never perfectly sharp. The only issue I've run into is that Real Tone, which is Google's image-processing algorithm for different skin tones, hasn't been as accurate as on prior Pixels, specifically on brown skin. (Google says it's looking into it.)

But the top reason why I heartily recommend Pixel phones is because of the smart software features you won't find on any other sub-$500 smartphone. I've detailed many of them here, but you can use Magic Editor to move a subject a little to the left of the frame and erase an unwanted object in the shot. You can use Best Take to fix that group shot where your eyes were closed. Google's Call Screen technology nips spam calls in the bud, and Assistant Voice Typing is still my favorite voice-to-text system and I miss it every time I switch phones.

Other perks include secure face unlock and fingerprint unlock—both work with sensitive apps that require biometric authentication so you have more unlocking options. There's also NFC for contactless payments and an IP67 rating that protects it from the elements.

Works on all three major US carriers.

## Best Cheap iPhone

Note: Apple is rumored to launch a new iPhone SE in the spring of 2025. I recommend waiting.

Want a cheap iPhone? The third-generation iPhone SE 2022 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the way to go, even if it's getting a bit dated. The current model doesn’t change much externally from its predecessor—you still get a 4.7-inch LCD that feels cramped to type on, with thick bezels on the top and bottom. It looks old, but maybe you like that; it’s the only iPhone Apple sells with a home button and Touch ID.

Apple stuffed the same chip that powers the iPhone 13 range from 2021, the A15 Bionic, into the iPhone SE 2022, meaning it's a speedy little handset that can handle anything you throw at it. This chip also improves battery life, but this tiny phone will still last only about a day, maybe less if you use it a lot. There’s 5G support and wireless charging. (It does not have MagSafe support.)

The lone camera on the back takes great photos during the day and handles high-contrast scenes well, but unfortunately, Apple still didn’t include Night mode, which is available on its pricier iPhones. That means in low light you can expect muddy, grainy, and blurry shots that don’t hold a candle to what you’ll capture on our top pick.

At the very least, this iPhone will last a long time, as Apple has supported its devices for years. I’d recommend slapping a case on the glass back and a screen protector on the front to keep it looking fresh—our favorite iPhone SE accessories can help.

## For Great Battery Life

The Pixel 8A is the more well-rounded midrange smartphone, but there are several reasons why you might prefer the OnePlus 12R. It sports a larger 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with a 120-Hz screen resolution, so while the interactions with the display are just as fluid, the bigger display is great for entertainment. It trounces the Pixel on battery life thanks to its 5,500-mAh cell capacity, which lasted for nearly two full days on a single charge with average use. If it's running out of juice, you can use the included cable and charging adapter to bring it from zero to 100 percent in just 30 minutes. It's a shame there's no wireless charging support.

It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the flagship processor of 2023, so it'll easily crush demanding games. However, the software isn't as smart as what you'll find on the Pixel. It still looks slick and doesn't have much bloatware, and OnePlus promises three Android OS upgrades with four years of security updates. It's not seven years, but it's better than most other Android phones at this price.

The 12R cuts corners in a few areas. It's rated for only IP64 water resistance, so it'll be OK in the rain but not if you drop it in the pool. The primary camera is solid and can go toe-to-toe with the Pixel 8A's camera; however, I found the ultrawide and macro cameras useless. It'd be better if OnePlus cut those and dropped the phone's price instead.

If you're not a shutterbug and want a phone with a powerful processor and a battery that lasts more than a day, the OnePlus 12R is a no-brainer.
