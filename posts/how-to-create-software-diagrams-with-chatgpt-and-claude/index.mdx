For the first iteration, I referred Claude to the extension’s JavaScript code and asked it to diagram the architecture. That yielded a useful but slightly broken ASCII diagram.

The major difference between the V2 and V3 versions, by the way, was that in V3, the DOM parsing — which in V2 had been happening in the background script — moved to the content script. That’s because the background script was now a service worker (as mandated by V3) that lacked access to the DOM-parsing API.

What else mandated by V3 had been incorporated into the new version of the extension? I asked, and Claude gave me the rundown: the split between permissions and host_permissions, and promise-based messaging. This was a delightful inversion of the pre-LLM process. Before, I’d have read up on Manifest V3, figured out which aspects were relevant to my project, and then worked out how to apply them. Now I had working code with an explanation that I could interrogate in the context of the code.

The entities and data flows in Claude’s diagram were roughly what I had envisioned. I could have fixed the broken ASCII layout with a bit of hand editing, but that felt silly. I’d rather enlist a proper tool for this job, especially one that could round-trip a concise human-writeable syntax.
