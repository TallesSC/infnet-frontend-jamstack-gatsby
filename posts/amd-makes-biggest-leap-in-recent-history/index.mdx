AMD has gained a substantial 5.7 percentage points of share of the desktop x86 CPU market in the third quarter compared to Q2, the largest quarterly share gain since we began tracking the market share reports in 2016. It also represents an incredible ten percentage point improvement over the prior year. AMD also raked in a strong increase in revenue share, jumping 8.5 percentage points over the prior quarter, indicating that it is selling a strong mix of higher-end CPU models.

During the quarter, AMD launched its new Ryzen 9000-series family of processors amid a scandal related to stability issues with Intel's Raptor Lake chips, which generated a flood of negative press for the company over the course of several months, and inventory adjustments for one of Intel's customers. AMD now commands 28.7% of the desktop processor market. AMD also continued to gain share in the laptop and server markets, though its gains on the desktop side of the business were the most impressive, according to Mercury Research.

In Q3 2024, Intel maintained a strong lead in the client PC market, commanding 76.1% of the market in terms of units, while AMD held a smaller 23.9% share. However, the dynamics are not in Intel's favor, as AMD gained 2.9 percentage points (pp) quarter-over-quarter and 4.6 pp year-over-year, which are significant achievements. Intel will, of course, continue to lead in client PCs for the foreseeable future as the company has extensive and diverse product offerings for client PCs, an entrenched position in the corporate PC sector, and access to its vast manufacturing capacities.
